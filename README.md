How can generative art using programming help us in understanding aesthetics? What are the limits of this process? How can painting be developed further using this approach? These are some of the questions this project aims to address and explore by painting using code.

This project is built on the Processing programming environment. Many pieces of code floating in the cyberspace have served as inspiration and this project aspires to do the same in turn.
