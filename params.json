What are the limits of this process? How can painting be developed further using this approach? These are some of the questions this project aims to address and explore by painting using code.\r\n\r\n[Beard-Coded](http://beard-coded.tumblr.com/) is built on the [Processing](http://www.processing.org) programming environment. Many pieces of code floating in the cyberspace have served as inspiration and this project aspires to do the same in turn. The code is hosted on public domain on github.\r\n\r\n**Srinivas Mangipudi**\r\n\r\n\r\nA gallery of images generated by different algorithms.\r\n<table style=\"width:194px;\"><tr><td align=\"center\" style=\"height:194px;background:url(https://www.gstatic.com/pwa/s/v/lighthousefe_20140824.00_p2/transparent_album_background.gif) no-repeat left\"><a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/118340175607400565547/BeardCoded?authuser=0&feat=embedwebsite\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JP55PHCrQzA/VAImrqw__8E/AAAAAAAAILw/1b1sdVOQD1o/s160-c/BeardCoded.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\" style=\"margin:1px 0 0 4px;\"></a></td></tr></table>","google":"UA-54334328-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
